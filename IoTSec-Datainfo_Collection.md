# **Comprehensive Device Performance Analytics**

## **Overview**
The Comprehensive Device Performance Analytics script provides deep insights into the performance and health of IoT devices. This script tracks device uptime, analyzes battery usage, identifies devices with frequent maintenance needs, and predicts future maintenance requirements based on historical data.

## **Key Features**
- **Device Uptime Tracking:** Tracks and aggregates the uptime of each device, providing insights into overall performance and identifying potential issues.
- **Battery Usage Analysis:** Monitors battery usage patterns to detect and address potential battery-related issues before they cause device failures.
- **Maintenance Identification:** Identifies devices that require frequent maintenance, allowing for proactive management and reducing downtime.
- **Predictive Maintenance:** Uses historical data to predict when devices are likely to need maintenance, helping to prevent unexpected failures.
- **Performance Reporting:** Generates detailed reports on device performance and maintenance, providing actionable insights for optimizing operations.

## **Usage**

- **Track Device Uptime:**
  Aggregate and analyze the uptime of each device using the `trackDeviceUptime()` function.
  ```javascript
  trackDeviceUptime();
  ```

- **Analyze Battery Usage:**
  Monitor and analyze battery usage patterns to identify potential issues using the `analyzeBatteryUsage()` function.
  ```javascript

  ```

- **Identify Frequent Maintenance Needs:**
  Identify devices that require frequent maintenance with the `identifyFrequentMaintenance()` function.
  ```javascript
  identifyFrequentMaintenance();
  ```

- **Predict Maintenance Needs:**
  Use the `predictMaintenanceNeeds()` function to predict future maintenance needs based on historical usage patterns.
  ```javascript
  predictMaintenanceNeeds();
  ```

- **Generate Performance Report:**
  Generate a detailed performance report for all devices using the `generatePerformanceReport()` function.
  ```javascript
  generatePerformanceReport();
  ```

- **Generate Maintenance Report:**
  Generate a comprehensive maintenance report for all devices using the `generateMaintenanceReport()` function.
  ```javascript
  generateMaintenanceReport();
