# **Real-Time Anomaly Detection and Incident Response**

## **Overview**
The Real-Time Anomaly Detection and Incident Response script continuously monitors IoT devices for unusual activity, triggering alerts and initiating responses as needed. This script is designed to ensure that any deviations from normal device behavior are quickly identified and addressed.

## **Key Features**
- **Continuous Monitoring:** The script monitors device data in real-time, looking for anomalies such as temperature spikes, unauthorized access, battery failures, and network anomalies.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Uses predefined thresholds and conditions to detect various types of anomalies, ensuring that any abnormal behavior is identified promptly.
- **Automated Alerts:** Triggers alerts whenever an anomaly is detected, allowing for immediate action to be taken.
- **Incident Response:** Automatically initiates incident responses, logging the actions taken to resolve the anomaly.
- **Anomaly Resolution:** Provides tools for resolving and archiving anomalies, keeping the system updated and clean.

## **Usage**

- **Monitor Anomalies:**
  The script automatically monitors for anomalies as device data is updated in the system. This function runs continuously and does not require user intervention.
  ```javascript
  monitorAnomalies();
  ```

- **Detect and Respond to Anomalies:**
  Anomalies such as temperature spikes, unauthorized access, and network anomalies are detected automatically, with alerts triggered and responses initiated.
  ```javascript
  detectTemperatureSpike(deviceData);
  detectUnauthorizedAccess(deviceData);
  detectBatteryFailure(deviceData);
  detectNetworkAnomalies(deviceData);
  ```

- **Resolve Anomalies:**
  Use the `resolveAnomaly()` function to manually resolve and archive an anomaly once it has been addressed.
  ```javascript
  resolveAnomaly(anomalyId);
